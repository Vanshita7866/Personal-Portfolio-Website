# Project Overview
This project aims to create a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and Vue 3. The website serves as a showcase of past projects and details about the creator. The implementation includes essential concepts from HTML, CSS, and Vue 3.

# HTML
## HTML Elements: 
Utilized various HTML elements, including tables for project lists, form elements for contact information, headers for section titles, and a favicon for branding.
# CSS
## Media Queries: 
Ensured a responsive design with media queries to adapt the layout for different screen sizes.
## Responsive Layout: 
Implemented a responsive layout using Flexbox, providing optimal viewing on various devices.
## External CSS File: 
Organized styling in an external CSS file (styles.css) to maintain code modularity.

# Vue 3
## Vue Router: 
Implemented Vue Router for navigation between different sections of the portfolio.
## Handling User Inputs: 
Utilized directives such as v-for, v-if, and v-model for dynamic rendering of project lists and managing user inputs.
## Vue Components: 
Created Vue components for modularity, separating different sections like the project list, about me, and contact form.

## Reflection
Building this personal portfolio website has been a rewarding experience that allowed me to apply and deepen my understanding of HTML, CSS, and Vue 3 concepts. The responsive design features ensure accessibility across various devices, while the use of Vue Router and components enhances the website's organization and maintainability.

In terms of HTML, the inclusion of diverse elements showcases my proficiency, and the use of media queries and responsive layouts in CSS contributes to a seamless user experience. Vue 3 played a crucial role in adding interactivity and dynamism to the portfolio, especially in handling user inputs and creating reusable components.

Through this project, I have not only met the basic requirements of the task but also strived for excellence by implementing creative and technically sound solutions. This experience has strengthened my skills in web development and has provided a tangible representation of my capabilities for potential employers.
